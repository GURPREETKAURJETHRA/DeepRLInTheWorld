# Deep RL in The Real World

This is a list of the many places deep reinforcement learning is already being used in the world. Feel free to contribute additions to this list and I will filter through them and accept the ones that seem to fit the criteria real world reinforcement learning.


## The list

The list is a two part list for each item inlcude a link to an article or video to make the application clear and easy to read for the average person. Also, include a link to the research paper or technical report that provides futher details on the work and how it relates to other work. See the posts below for examples on this format.

* Deep reinforcement learning is being used to train mobile robots with arms to clean rooms.
